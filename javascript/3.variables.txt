variable is container for storing data values

keywords to declare variables in JavaScript:
var, let, const

variable syntax:

keywords variablename = value;

//var is function scoped or globally scoped, and can be redeclared and reassigned

var title = "learn javascript";
var title = "learn javascript again"; // redeclaring a var variable
title = "learn javascript once more"; // reassigning a var variable
// console.log(title);

// let is block scoped and not redeclarable but reassignable

let firstName = "John";
// let firstName = "Jane"; // This will throw an error because let does not allow redeclaration
firstName = "John Doe"; // This is allowed as it is a reassignmentS
// console.log(firstName);


// const is block scoped, not redeclarable, and not reassignable

const lastName = "Doe";
const lastName = "Doe"; // This will throw an error because const does not allow redeclaration
lastName = "Smith"; // This will also throw an error because const does not allow reassignment
console.log(lastName);
