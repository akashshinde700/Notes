# Programming Language

A programming language is a way to give commands to your system, designed to be:

- **Understood by humans**: Readable and writable by people.
- **Understood by computers/machines**: Executable by systems.

## Why Need a Programming Language?
Programming languages help us communicate precise instructions to computers, enabling them to perform tasks as intended.

# Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language used to create interactive and dynamic behavior on websites.

- **High-level**: Closer to human language, making it easier to read and write.
- **Interpreted**: Code is executed line by line without needing compilation.

JavaScript brings websites to life by responding to user actions like clicks, mouse movements, or typing. It runs:
- **In browsers**: To make web pages interactive.
- **On servers**: Using Node.js for backend logic and data handling.

## JavaScript Evolution Timeline

### 1995
- **Brendan Eich** created JavaScript at Netscape in just 10 days.
- Originally named **Mocha**, then **LiveScript**, and finally **JavaScript**.

### 1996
- **Microsoft** released **JScript**, its version of JavaScript for Internet Explorer.

### 1997
- JavaScript was standardized as **ECMAScript** (ECMA-262) by ECMA International.

### 2009
- **Node.js**, introduced by **Ryan Dahl**, allowed JavaScript to run on servers, expanding its use beyond browsers.

### 2015 – ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)
A major update that modernized JavaScript with features like:
- `let` and `const` for block-scoped variables.
- Arrow functions (`=>`).
- Classes and Modules for better code organization.
- Promises for handling asynchronous code.
- Template literals (`${}` syntax).
- Destructuring, default parameters, spread/rest operators, and more.

## Where JavaScript is Used Today
JavaScript is versatile and powers:
- **Web Apps**: Frameworks like React, Angular, Vue.
- **Mobile Apps**: React Native, NativeScript.
- **Desktop Apps**: Electron.
- **Servers**: Node.js.
- **IoT Devices**, **Game Development**, **AI**, and more.

## Why is it Called JavaScript?
The name "JavaScript" was chosen for **marketing reasons**, not because it’s closely related to Java. Its syntax and features draw from multiple languages:
- **Java, C, C++**: Core structure (e.g., `if`, `for`, `while`, curly braces `{}`, semicolons `;`).
- **Perl and Awk**: Regular expressions and scripting flexibility.
- **Python**: Dynamic typing and ease of use.
- **Self**: Prototype-based object model (unlike Java’s class-based system).

JavaScript is a unique blend of these influences, creating a flexible and powerful language.

# IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

An **IDE** is a software tool that streamlines coding by combining tools for writing, testing, and debugging code in one place.

## Main Features of an IDE
- **Code Editor**: For writing and editing code.
- **Compiler/Interpreter**: Converts code to machine-readable form.
- **Debugger**: Identifies and fixes errors.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Color-codes elements for readability.
- **Code Autocomplete**: Suggests code to speed up writing.
- **Project/File Explorer**: Organizes files and folders.
- **Terminal/Console**: Runs code within the IDE.
- **Extensions/Plugins**: Adds features like Git integration, linters, or themes.

## Popular IDEs/Editors
