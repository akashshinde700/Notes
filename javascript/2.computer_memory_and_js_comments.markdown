# üß† What is Memory?

Memory is the part of a computer where data is stored and accessed during processing. It enables the CPU (the computer's brain) to perform tasks by holding instructions, data, and results either temporarily or permanently.

# Types of Memory in Computers

## 1. Primary Memory (Main Memory)
Used directly by the CPU while programs are running.

- **RAM (Random Access Memory)**  
  - Temporary memory that stores data while programs are active.  
  - Data is lost when the computer is turned off.  
- **ROM (Read-Only Memory)**  
  - Permanent memory that stores startup instructions (e.g., BIOS).  
  - Data remains even when power is off.  

üí° **Analogy**:  
- RAM is like your workspace while working.  
- ROM is like a user manual for starting your computer.

## 2. Secondary Memory (Storage Memory)
Stores data permanently for long-term use.

- **Examples**:  
  - HDD (Hard Disk Drive)  
  - SSD (Solid State Drive)  
  - USB drives, CDs, DVDs  

üí° **Analogy**: Secondary memory is like a filing cabinet where you save files and projects.

# üõ†Ô∏è Memory in Programming (like JavaScript)

When a program runs, memory is used to store:

- **Variables and data**  
- **Functions and objects**  
- **Intermediate results and temporary values**

In JavaScript, memory is divided into:

- **Stack**: Stores primitive values (small, fixed-size data like numbers, booleans).  
- **Heap**: Stores reference types (like objects, arrays, functions).  

### Volatile vs Non-Volatile Memory
- **Volatile Memory**: Data is lost when power is off (e.g., RAM).  
- **Non-Volatile Memory**: Data is saved permanently (e.g., ROM, HDD, SSD).  

JavaScript uses **Primary Memory (RAM)** for the Stack and Heap during runtime.

# Comments in JavaScript

Comments are lines in the code that are not executed. They are used to explain code, improve readability, or temporarily disable code.

## 1. Single-Line Comment
- Starts with `//`.  
- Used for short notes.  

```javascript
// This is a single-line comment
let name = "Akash"; // This sets the user's name
```

## 2. Multi-Line Comment
- Starts with `/*` and ends with `*/`.  
- Used for longer explanations or to comment out blocks of code.  

```javascript
/*
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span multiple lines.
Useful for detailed descriptions.
*/
```
