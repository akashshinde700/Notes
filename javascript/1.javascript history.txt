                                                   Programming Language

Programming Language is a way to give commands to your  system

i>understand by humans 
ii>understand by computer/machine also

why need programming language?

programming language helps us talk to computers and tell them exactly what to do

                                                Introduction To JavaScript

JavaScript is high level,interpreted programming language ,used to create interactive and dynamic behavior on website.                            

high level means - JavaScript closer to human language, so it is easy to read and write.
interpreted means -JavaScript code is run line by line

JavaScript lets websites respond when you click, move, or type—making them feel alive.

JavaScript runs in the browser to make pages interactive and on servers (with Node.js) to handle data and backend logic.

📜 JavaScript Evolution Timeline
1995
🔹 Brendan Eich created JavaScript at Netscape in just 10 days. //ब्रेन-डन आइच
🔹 Originally named Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally JavaScript.

1996
🔹 Microsoft released JScript, its own version of JavaScript for Internet Explorer.

1997
🔹 JavaScript was officially standardized as ECMAScript (ECMA-262) by ECMA International.

2009
🔹 Node.js was introduced by Ryan Dahl, enabling JavaScript to run on servers (outside the browser).

2015 – ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)
🔹 A major update that modernized JavaScript:

let, const for block-scoped variables

Arrow functions (=>)

Classes and Modules

Promises for async code

Template literals (${} syntax)

Destructuring, default parameters, spread/rest operators, and more

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now (Today) // WHere We can use

🔹 JavaScript is everywhere:

🌐 Web Apps – React, Angular, Vue

📱 Mobile Apps – React Native, NativeScript

💻 Desktop Apps – Electron

🌍 Servers – Node.js

📡 IoT Devices, Game Dev, AI, and beyond

why is it called javascript?

JavaScript got its name mainly for marketing reasons, not because it’s closely related to Java.

JavaScript’s syntax borrows mainly from Java, but it also takes inspiration from C, C++, Perl, Awk, and even Python in some areas.
Here’s a quick breakdown of what it borrows:
- 🧱 Java, C, and C++: Basic structure like if, for, while, curly braces {}, semicolons ;, and variable declarations.
- 🧪 Perl and Awk: Influenced JavaScript’s regular expressions and scripting-style flexibility.
- 🐍 Python: Some influence in its dynamic typing and ease of use.
- 🧬 Self: Inspired JavaScript’s prototype-based object model (instead of class-based like Java).
So while the name “JavaScript” might suggest it’s a sibling of Java, it’s more like a mashup of several languages—with its own unique personality.

                                             IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

IDE is a software tool that helps you write, test, and debug code more efficiently—all in one place.

✅ Main Features of an IDE

Code Editor – Write and edit your code
Compiler / Interpreter – Convert code to machine language
Debugger – Find and fix errors
Syntax Highlighting – Colors to easily spot code elements
Code Autocomplete – Suggests code while typing
Project/File Explorer – Organizes files and folders
Terminal/Console – Run code directly inside the IDE
Extensions/Plugins – Add new features (like Git, Linters, Themes)

| IDE/Editor       | Description                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **VS Code**      | Most popular, lightweight, and extensible IDE |
| **WebStorm**     | Powerful JS IDE by JetBrains (paid)           |
| **Sublime Text** | Fast, minimal editor with plugin support      |
| **Atom**         | Open-source editor by GitHub (now deprecated) |
| **Brackets**     | Beginner-friendly, focused on web development |
