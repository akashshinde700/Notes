Life Cycle of a Change in Git
1. Modify Files
You change your files on your computer. These changes are only on your disk — Git doesn’t track them yet.
2. Check Changes
Run:
git diff
to see what changes you made (not saved to Git yet).
3.Stage Changes
git add filename
or
git add .
to tell Git: "I want to include these changes in the next save."
4. Check Staged Changes
git diff –staged
to see what changes are ready to be saved (committed).
5.Commit Changes
git commit -m "Your message here"
This saves your changes in Git history with a message describing what you did
6.Push Changes (optional)
If you use a remote repository (like GitHub), run:
git push
to send your saved changes to the remote server.
