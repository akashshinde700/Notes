                                              HTML

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
It is the basic language used to create websites.
HTML gives structure and meaning to web content.

🌐What does HyperText mean?
HyperText means clickable links.
These links help you move from one page to another on the internet.

For example, 
when you click on a word or picture and it takes you to a new page — that's HyperText!

🧱 What is Markup?
Markup means adding labels to parts of a web page.
It tells the browser what each part is, like a heading, paragraph, or image.

HTML uses tags (like <p> or <h1>) to do this.
These tags help the web browser know how to show the content.

🏷️ What are HTML Tags?
Tags look like this: <tagname>.
Example: <p> for a paragraph.
Most tags come in pairs:
Opening tag: <p>
Closing tag: </p>

Tags are not case-sensitive, but it’s best to write them in lowercase.

🧩 Common HTML Elements
<head> – Info about the page
<title> – Page title (seen on browser tab)
<body> – Main content
<p> – Paragraph
<div> – Container for content
<img> – Image
<a> – Link
<ul>, <ol>, <li> – Lists (unordered, ordered, list items)
<video>, <audio> – Media

💬 HTML Comments
Used to add notes in the code.
Not shown on the webpage.
Example: <!-- This is a comment -->

✍️ Attributes in HTML
Attributes give extra information about an element.
Written inside the opening tag.
Example: <img src="image.jpg" alt="My Image">
src = image source
alt = alternative text

🌍 HTML + CSS + JavaScript
HTML = Structure
CSS = Appearance (colors, layout)
JavaScript = Behavior (what the page does)

📄 Forms and Media
Forms help with actions like login, register, or send info.
HTML supports media like audio and video using tags like <audio> and <video>.

Block vs Inline Elements
Block-level: Takes full width (e.g., <div>, <p>)
Inline-level: Only takes up as much space as needed (e.g., <span>, <a>)

Extra Tips
Use <link rel="preload"> to load important files early.
Use responsive images for better performance on different devices.
