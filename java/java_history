                                                   Programming Language

Programming Language is a way to give commands to your system

i>understand by humans
ii>understand by computer/machine also

why need programming language?

programming language helps us talk to computers and tell them exactly what to do

                                               Software Prerequisites to Learn Java

Java Development Kit (JDK):
This is the main tool you need to write and run Java programs.

Text Editor or IDE (Code Editor)
You need a place to write your Java code. You can use:
VS Code – simple and beginner-friendly

                                                  Introduction to Java Programming

Java is a computer programming language that was created in 1991 by a company called Sun Microsystems,
which is now owned by Oracle Corporation.
It was developed by two people named James Gosling and Patrick Naughton.

Java is Object-oriented ,General-purpose, Robust, Platform-independent language means

Object-oriented :
Java uses "objects" to build programs.
An object is like a real-world thing (for example: a car, a dog, or a book).

Each object has:
Data (like the color or size)
Actions (like drive, bark, or open)

So, Java makes programs by using these objects, just like how we see things in real life.

General-purpose :
general-purpose means Java is not limited to just one use — it can be used almost anywhere

You can use Java to make:

Mobile apps (like Android apps)
Computer software (like calculators or games)
Web applications (like online shopping sites)
Big business systems (used by banks, schools, etc.)

Robust:
Java is robust because it keeps working even if there are small problems in the code.
It can handle mistakes (errors) in the program without crashing.
It helps programmers find and fix problems easily.

Platform-independent:
Java programs can run on any computer (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.).
You write the code once, and it will work everywhere.
This is because Java uses something called the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which helps it run on any system.
