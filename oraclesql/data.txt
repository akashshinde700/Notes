                                         Data

data is meanigful information

data is information that has been translated into a form that is efficient for movement or processing

                                         Types of data 

Unstructured data
data that is usually not as easily searchable 
can not be easily converted into information
example
handwritten application,emails,essays,terms and conditions ,text file etc

structured data
data in predefined types and patterns
can be easily converted into information
example
forms-government,school, etc
bank passbook,excel file etc


Predefined Types in Structured Data
These are specific, allowed data formats or categories:

Type	Description	Example
Integer	Whole numbers	42, -10
Float/Decimal	Numbers with decimal points	3.14, 0.99
String	Text data	"John", "NYC"
Boolean	True/false values	TRUE, FALSE
Date/Time	Temporal data	2025-07-13, 14:00:00

ðŸ”¹ Predefined Patterns in Structured Data
Patterns define how data should be structured or organized. Examples include:

1. Tabular Format (Relational Databases)
Data stored in rows and columns

Each column has a data type

Tables can be linked via keys

ID	Name	Age	Email
1	Alice	30	alice@email.com


2. Regular Expressions (for data validation)
Patterns used to ensure correct formatting:

Email: ^\S+@\S+\.\S+$

Phone number: \(\d{3}\) \d{3}-\d{4}

ZIP code: \d{5}

3. Schemas (e.g., in XML, JSON, SQL)
Define rules for data structure:

Field names

Data types

Optional vs required fields

Example (JSON Schema):

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "username": { "type": "string" },
    "age": { "type": "integer" }
  },
  "required": ["username", "age"]
}
ðŸ”¹ Summary
Feature	Structured Data
Storage Format	Tables, fields, rows, columns
Data Types	Predefined (int, string, date, etc.)
Patterns	Schemas, regular expressions, table design
Tools	SQL, Excel, CSV, JSON with schema
Pros	Fast querying, easy validation and sorting
Cons	Less flexible for unstructured content

Term	Meaning	Grammar
Datum	A single piece of information	Singular noun
Data	Multiple pieces of information	Originally plural, now often singular/mass noun

Origin and History
Both words come from Latin:

Datum means "something given" (past participle of dare, "to give").

Data is the plural form of datum.


The word "datum" has been in use since the 1600s.

The plural "data" entered English in the 17th century as well.

In scientific and technical writing, many purists still prefer the original Latin usage (plural for data).

But in everyday use, "data" is often singular and treated as uncountable.

Fast searches and maintenance.
Interesting fact: IBM created its first database for
NASA's moon mission 1968 - Information Control System and Data Language/Interface (ICS/DL/I). ICS is renamed to Information Management System/360 (IMS/360) and became available to the IT world in 1969.
